Unweaving the rainbow — recovering data from scientific images with unknown colourmaps.

I think this bot will be called `keats`. From John Keats's poem _Lamia_

>Do not all charms fly
>At the mere touch of cold philosophy?
>There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:
>We know her woof, her texture; she is given
>In the dull catalogue of common things.
>Philosophy will clip an Angel's wings,
>Conquer all mysteries by rule and line,
>Empty the haunted air, and gnomèd mine—
>Unweave a rainbow, as it erewhile made
>The tender-person'd Lamia melt into a shade.
